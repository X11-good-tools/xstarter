There's [Emacs interface](https://github.com/lchsk/helm-xstarter) available for xstarter!

![`helm-xstarter` session](data/helm_xstarter.png)

It uses Helm interface that many Emacs users are familiar with. 

It loads a list of installed applications and lets a user select one to launch. It also records recently open programs and shows them on top.

**See [github page for installation instructions](https://github.com/lchsk/helm-xstarter)**!
