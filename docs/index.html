<h2 id='running_xstarter'>Running xstarter</h2>

<p>xstarter needs to be launched from a terminal ($ xstarter). It is useful to run it using a key binding, preferably by binding your preferred key to a command starting xstarter from a terminal of your choice, e.g. xterm -e xstarter. Alternatively, you can simply bind it to xstarter in which case xstarter will open itself in a terminal.</p>

<p>You can also create an alias in your shell (e.g. bash, zsh): <code>alias xs=xstarter</code>.</p>

<p>It should run on any modern terminal. It is tested on: <code>xterm, rxvt, gnome-terminal, xfce4-terminal, konsole</code>. In case of any problems please report it.</p>

<h2 id='configuration'>Configuration</h2>

<p>Configuration file is available and includes comments that explain configuration variables. It is located in the <code>~/.xstarter.d/</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id='providing_arguments_to_applications'>Providing arguments to applications</h2>

<p>You can provide arguments to applications you wish to open.</p>

<p>If the number of search results is equal to 1, you can provide arguments the selected application should be started with, e.g. <code>surf xstarter.org</code> You can provide multiple arguments, e.g. <code>emacs -nw -Q</code> You can select the application you want to provide arguments for by pressing Tab key This feature works both with GUI (press Enter to start) and terminal applications (press C-o to start)</p>
