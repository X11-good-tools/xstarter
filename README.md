## Run xstarter using a key binding

**xstarter** needs to be launched from a terminal. If you want to run it using a key binding, bind your preferred shortcut to the `./bin/xstarter_run` file.

It should run on any modern terminal. It is tested on: `xterm`, `rxvt`, `gnome-terminal`, `xfce4-terminal`, `konsole`. In case of any problems please [report it](https://github.com/lchsk/xstarter/issues/new).

## Configuration

[Configuration file](./xstarter.conf) is available and includes comments that explain configuration variables. It should be placed in the `~/.xstarter.d/` directory.
