## Running xstarter

**xstarter** needs to be launched from a terminal. It is useful to run it using a key binding, preferably by binding your preferred key to a command starting **xstarter** from a terminal of your choice, e.g. `xterm -e xstarter`. Alternatively, you can simply bind it to `xstarter` in which case xstarter will open itself in a terminal.

You can also create an alias in your shell (e.g. bash, zsh): `alias xs=path-to-xstarter`.

It should run on any modern terminal. It is tested on: `xterm`, `rxvt`, `gnome-terminal`, `xfce4-terminal`, `konsole`. In case of any problems please [report it](https://github.com/lchsk/xstarter/issues/new).

## Configuration

[Configuration file](./xstarter.conf) is available and includes comments that explain configuration variables. It is located in the `~/.xstarter.d/` directory.
